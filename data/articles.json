A closer look reveals that illiquidity, opacity and scalability challenges have plagued global financial markets for long. They weren&rsquo;t in great shape anyway, trade war or no trade war.</p><p>Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have risen to this occasion &mdash; thankfully. For one, they ensure predictable yields, providing a haven for investors amid uncertain market conditions and unproductive volatility.&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, though, RWAs are a lifeboat for legacy finance, as they enhance market liquidity, bring transparency to opaque markets, and make finance more democratic. Traditional financial markets need to integrate &mdash; not resist &mdash; RWAs to stay relevant in the coming&nbsp;decade.&nbsp;</p><h2>RWAs to the rescue</h2><p>In legacy finance, capital&rsquo;s &ldquo;computability&rdquo; occurs through slow, expensive and unreliable intermediaries like banks. For example, these entities are primarily unable to rebalance portfolios quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>This limits market scope, and consumers bear significant losses. There are persistent trust issues across the board, while fund managers face immense administrative burdens in handling clients. The bottom line: Everyone suffers, except the value-sucking go-betweens.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s a big reason fundraising in private equity, a key pillar of global financial markets, declined 24% in 2024, per McKinsey&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/global-private-markets-report\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\"> report</a>. Likewise, as the SIFMA 2025 Capital Markets Outlook<a href=\"https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Capital-Markets-Outlook-SIFMA.pdf\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\"> revealed</a>, US equity issuance has decreased by 0.6% annually since 2020. Initial public offerings have been down 8.5% during this period.&nbsp;</p><p>RWAs fix these. They make portfolio management more straightforward and seamless, with scalable capital deployment even in turbulent markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Tokenization automates verifiable transactions, enabling precise, deterministic, trustless economies &mdash; turning the status quo on its head. It also provides investors with low-risk, low-cost and rapid access to existing and emerging global financial markets.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-ways-real-world-asset-tokenization-is-transforming-tradfi\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/5-ways-real-world-asset-tokenization-is-transforming-tradfi\"><em><strong>5 ways real-world asset tokenization is transforming TradFi</strong></em></a></p><p>No wonder onchain RWAs increased 85% to over $15 billion in 2024. And this <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-boom-bitcoin-yields-top-crypto-trends-2025'\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">trend still has momentum</a>. RWAs are poised to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-investments-2025-bitcoin-ai-rwa\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">remain a top investment category in crypto</a>.</p><p>RWAs reached a new all-time high recently, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-tokenization-growth-bitcoin-2025\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">surpassing $17 billion</a>, with over 82,000 asset holders. Notably, tokenized private credit is the largest asset in the RWA industry, with over $11 billion in valuation.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear that investors chose RWAs in the face of a $10-billion liquidation and general, persistent market volatility. Moreover, this asset class is making private credit great again, laying the foundation for future financial markets.</p><h2>&ldquo;Smart money&rdquo; bets on RWAs&nbsp;</h2><p>JPMorgan, BlackRock, UBS, Citi, Goldman Sachs &mdash; all the big names in legacy finance have moved into RWAs. Capital inflows from such &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; entities helped onchain private credit grow 40% last year, while tokenized treasuries surged 179% overall.</p><p>All this could very well be routine diversification and capital expansion. But funds like Franklin Templeton&rsquo;s Franklin Onchain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) and BlackRock&rsquo;s US dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) signal a more long-term motive.&nbsp;</p><p>Initiatives like FOBXX and BUIDL are focused on <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-is-betting-on-30-t-rwa-tokenization\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">transforming money markets</a> through lower settlement times, easier liquidity access, better trading environments and other improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>They leverage tokenization to introduce novel yield-generating opportunities in traditionally illiquid markets like the private credit sector. As data from PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests, this could be a $1.5-trillion disruption. S&amp;P Global also believes private credit tokenization is the &ldquo;new digital frontier&rdquo; that solves liquidity and transparency issues.</p><p>RWAs are thus emerging as a viable, more lucrative alternative for institutional investors, who control nearly one-fourth of the $450-trillion legacy financial market. That&rsquo;s a strong enough waking sign &mdash; plus there&rsquo;s increasing demand from &ldquo;retail&rdquo; users (i.e., the remaining three-fourths of the pie).</p><h2>Retail is the end-game for RWAs</h2><p>Institutional adoption is excellent for building initial awareness around RWAs. Like it or not, their actions move the needle. In the long run, however, individual retail users stand to benefit most from RWAs.&nbsp;</p><p>RWAs make capital markets accessible to grassroots investors, including unbanked populations. Fractional ownership, for instance, lets those with smaller capital holdings get exposure to high-ticket assets otherwise reserved for wealthy family offices and institutions.</p><p>Because of these benefits, retail users will choose RWAs over traditional, exclusive financial assets and markets. And now it&rsquo;s a no-brainer for them, thanks to solutions like social investing platforms, which give users intuitive, hassle-free access to novel financial opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple reports from Mastercard to Tren Finance and VanEck showcase RWAs&rsquo; massive growth potential. It could be anywhere between $50 billion and $30 trillion over the next four to five years.&nbsp;</p><p>Widespread retail adoption will drive this growth, and unless traditional markets adapt or adopt RWAs, they will lose the vast majority of their users. With institutional and retail capital moving into this emerging sector, it&rsquo;s genuinely do-or-die for legacy systems.</p><p>Robust tools and platforms that leverage RWAs to bridge the gap between traditional and emerging financial markets are available now. That makes it a question of intent and priority more than anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch up or become obsolete &mdash; that&rsquo;s the message. It&rsquo;s the wartime arc, as it has been long due. The best part is that legacy assets coming onchain and markets leveraging RWAs will be a win-win for issuers, institutions and retail users. That&rsquo;s what the world needs from a financial standpoint. It&rsquo;s worth all the effort.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of ZIGChain.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

What if they&rsquo;re the very thing putting us at risk?</p><p>Instead of paving the way for mass adoption, this fixation has created <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/current-chain-abstraction-methods-fragmenting-crypto-web3-exec\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">a tangled web of rollups, bridges and fragmented liquidity</a>, threatening blockchain&rsquo;s core principles of decentralization and security. The dream of a seamless, decentralized network is fading, overshadowed by a complex system that echoes the inefficiencies and centralization of the traditional financial world. Are we scaling innovation or just recreating the past?</p><h2>The blockchain trilemma</h2><p>L2s were supposed to mitigate<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/layer-1-blockchain-project-proposes-infinite-scalability-as-part-of-trilemma-solution\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\"> the blockchain trilemma</a>. Yet, while they may fill the gaps at the individual level, as a movement, L2 solutions have put crypto at risk of losing all three.</p><p>The growing mass of L2s has led to a highly fractured ecosystem that&rsquo;s difficult to navigate and relies on complex rollups and bridging solutions. This has led to parts of the ecosystem centralizing, drawing assets into fragmented liquidity silos, hindering security and stifling competition for smaller projects.&nbsp;</p><p>These &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; have introduced large-scale friction and have also brought unnecessary security risks. While bridge-related hacks have become much <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-security-improvements-vs-cefi-losses-2024\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">less common in the last two years</a>, hackers will always find new ways to balance the books &mdash; exploiting rollups, channels and sidechains.&nbsp;</p><p>Many L2s&rsquo; reliance on sequencers or trusted validators creates additional cracks in the armor, single points of failure, while siloed liquidity reduces validator availability for smaller L2s, threatening network resilience.</p><p>These solutions also leave an immense technical challenge for developers building applications hoping to integrate with L2s, requiring in-depth and specific knowledge of the mechanics of each L2 the application may need to touch.</p><p>L2 proponents argue that these trade-offs are necessary and easily overcome, but there are even more fundamental issues here than sacrificing security, scalability or liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-has-had-its-cambrian-moment\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-has-had-its-cambrian-moment\"><em><strong>AI has had its Cambrian moment &mdash; Blockchain&rsquo;s is yet to come</strong></em></a></p><p>Crypto&rsquo;s endgame is a universal network where any asset or decentralized application can instantly interact with any other in a trustless, secure way. The friction that L2s introduce, however, sabotages this instant interoperability, while the centralization of sequencers and validators undermines the fundamentals of a trustless system. It is not just that this stymies scalability in decentralized finance (DeFi), but rather that it leads toward scaling something completely different, recreating the inefficiencies of the existing siloed, fragmented and middle-man-infested TradFi system.</p><p>If the goal of DeFi is to move all financial activity onchain, it is imperative to do better than what we already have.&nbsp;</p><h2>Building the foundations</h2><p>Crypto needs to build from the foundations up. Instead of outsourcing scalability and security, blockchain networks must prioritize them at layer 1.</p><p>Sharding offers a clear path forward, but the industry must set higher goals and build a long-term solution rather than just a quick fix to &ldquo;band-aid&rdquo; the immediate scalability problem of the day. It is not just about increasing the shard count; it is how we <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-proposal-rumors-devcon-justin-drake\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\">shard</a>. The Beacon Chain just adds a bottleneck, and dynamic sharding is complicated, limiting scalability with massive overheads. Even intra-validator sharding seems to solve all of these problems until you reach resource saturation on the network-facing node, which has to ingest all transactions, simply kicking the can down the road in search of more validators and diminishing returns.</p><p>The obvious solution for scaling DeFi to the same capabilities as TradFi is state sharding, which is the state of the blockchain distributed across many different shards. Transactions that involve states from different shards create a temporary consensus process.&nbsp;</p><p>The validators responsible for the transaction state communicate, agree (or not), and update the state atomically in all relevant shards. This allows transactions to be processed in parallel across multiple shards and even within shards themselves, leaving a shard&rsquo;s only concern that the transactions modifying the state for which they are responsible do not have intersecting dependencies, significantly increasing throughput without compromising decentralization or accessibility.&nbsp;</p><p>When these shards are integrated with atomic commitment, if any part of the transaction fails, everything aborts cleanly, and there&rsquo;s no work needed to untangle hanging state changes.</p><p>This is just one solution. DeFi will scale to onboard the planet. It is just a question of how soon and by what means. That said, solutions that focus on the fundamentals of L1 development rather than relying on a patchwork of L2s will eliminate fragmentation, reduce complexity, and ensure scalability and accessibility are again at the heart of blockchain networks. It comes down to the future that developers want to prioritize &mdash; tokenomics or the founding promises of Web3 &mdash; decentralization, efficiency and security.&nbsp;</p><h2>Scaling for the future</h2><p>L1 solutions are solutions for everybody. They secure the very foundation of the ecosystem for developers, traders, general users and even several billion prospective users. Without resilient and scalable architecture in the foundations, one strong push is all it will take to cause this house of cards to collapse. Of course, specific use cases might be better with L2 solutions. A high-frequency trade settlement is a perfect example, but exceptions never prove the rule. From a whole-ecosystem perspective, developers must focus on integrated, native scalability solutions instead of just adding complexity and balancing more precarious &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; on top. Without adequately attending to the L1, nothing but problems await.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Dan Hughes, founder of Radix.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

XDAO co-founder and chief operating officer Zurab Shavlidze told Cointelegraph that the protocol offers a standard for other &ldquo;sub-entities&rdquo; within its legal framework.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Basically, those sub-entities exist both in relation to each other and outside entities that had acknowledged their existence and assented to some articles of the XDAO Labs&rsquo; Constitution,&rdquo; Shavlidze told Cointelegraph.&nbsp;</p><p>XDAO added that the parties recognize Singapore, where XDAO Labs is incorporated, as the primary jurisdiction where disputes may be resolved if necessary.&nbsp;</p><h2>Signing legally-binding documents through Telegram bots</h2><p>The protocol also said it could enable the signing of legally binding documents using Web3 wallets. XDAO said DAOs could archive their transactions using a Telegram bot.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the security and practicality of its Telegram bot-based legal framework, Shavlidze said agreements formed through the messenger work in &ldquo;most jurisdictions.&rdquo; However, the XDAO co-founder outlined its limitations, including &ldquo;real estate, securities, and other matters that call for a prescribed procedure for the contract&rsquo;s formation.&rdquo; Shavlidze told Cointelegraph:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;However, when making agreements through a Telegram bot, it is important to approach the recording of all details and specifics responsibly, as this can later facilitate dispute resolution.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>The executive added that the bot can store information that DAO participants consider significant. It can even be used to conduct basic <em>Know Your Customer</em> procedures.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/texas-court-issues-judgment-against-bancor-dao-for-ignoring-summons\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Texas court issues judgment against Bancor DAO after it ignored summons</strong></em></a></p><h2>How smart contract-based compliance would work in practice</h2><p>When asked how their smart contract compliance models would work in arbitration scenarios, XDAO said the parties could form valid arbitration agreements through messenger or e-signature methods such as Docusign and Ethsign. This requires personalities to be firmly established and the &ldquo;intention to adjudicate the dispute is clearly expressed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Arbitration is a commonly recognized dispute resolution procedure, which exists under influential international conventions. Those conventions do not specify the exact way of making an arbitration agreement, apart from it being in writing,&rdquo; Shavlidze told Cointelegraph.&nbsp;</p><p>The executive added that if payment is required, an arbitrator can be added to the DAO with the right to a key vote. This would allow them to sign a transaction with their digital signature if the parties fail to reach a consensus.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/china-crypto-counterfeit-japans-stablecoin-push-asia-express/\" rel=\"null\" target=\"null\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Ridiculous &lsquo;Chinese Mint&rsquo; crypto scam, Japan dives into stablecoins: Asia Express</strong></em></a></p></p>\n</p>",

These cryptographic audits, using Merkle trees and onchain verifications, serve as a transparency mechanism in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/cryptocurrency-vs-stocks-key-differences-explained\">crypto</a>, much like capital adequacy requirements do for traditional finance.</p><p>But does the PoR concept draw inspiration from TradFi?</p><p>In traditional banking, regulators have long mandated that financial institutions maintain a certain level of capital reserves to safeguard against potential risks. This framework ensures that banks can absorb unexpected losses and continue to operate during economic downturns. A pivotal moment highlighting the importance of such regulations was the <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-the-global-financial-crisis-and-its-impact-on-the-global-economy\">2008 financial crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>During this crisis, many banks faced significant losses due to high-risk exposures, leading to a global economic downturn. In response, international regulatory bodies introduced more stringent measures to bolster the resilience of financial institutions.</p><p>One such measure is the Basel III framework, established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Basel III set forth comprehensive reforms to improve the regulation, supervision and risk management within the banking sector.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital requirements mandate financial services firms to hold a minimum amount of common equity relative to their risk-weighted assets, ensuring they have a solid capital base to cover potential losses.</li><li>Leverage ratio serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital requirements, limiting the extent to which a bank can leverage its capital base.</li><li>Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) ensures that banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario.</li><li>Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) promotes resilience over a longer time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with stable sources of funding.</li></ol><p>These measures aim to enhance the banking sector&rsquo;s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, thereby reducing the risk of systemic crises.</p><p>A parallel concept known as proof-of-reserves (PoR) audits has emerged in the world of cryptocurrencies to promote transparency and trust within digital asset platforms. PoR audits are cryptographic verifications that confirm whether a cryptocurrency exchange or custodian holds the assets it claims on behalf of its users.&nbsp;</p><p>These cryptographic audits, using <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/merkle-trees-vs-verkle-trees-explained\">Merkle trees</a> and onchain verifications, serve as a transparency mechanism in crypto. The primary goal is to provide assurance that these platforms are solvent and can meet customer withdrawal demands. Some audits provide the dollar equivalent of the reserves, whereas others report in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>).</p><h2>How do proof-of-reserves audits work?</h2><p>PoR audits use cryptographic methods like Merkle trees to verify that exchanges hold sufficient assets to cover user deposits, but they don&rsquo;t prove solvency, as they don&rsquo;t account for hidden liabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>These audits are designed to verify that cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians actually hold the assets they claim on behalf of their users. The process typically begins with asset verification, where platforms disclose wallet addresses or use cryptographic proofs, such as Merkle trees, to confirm holdings without revealing sensitive account details.&nbsp;</p><p>A Merkle tree allows user balances to be hashed and aggregated into a single &ldquo;Merkle root,&rdquo; which auditors and users can verify independently. Additionally, a third-party auditor may be involved to assess whether the exchange&rsquo;s reserves match its reported holdings. Alongside this, customer liability verification ensures that total deposits do not exceed available reserves, strengthening the credibility of the exchange&rsquo;s financial standing.</p><p><img alt=\"How Merkle trees verify exchange reserves and user balances\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/4df0ec510e49dbbfabba65e88fbdde3e.jpg\" title=\"How Merkle trees verify exchange reserves and user balances\" /></p><p>While traditional PoR audits rely on Merkle trees, they have limitations, such as the inability to prove solvency (i.e., whether an exchange has hidden liabilities or outstanding loans). To address this, ZK-proofs are being explored as a more private and secure method of reserve verification.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zksync-ecosystem\">Zero-knowledge (ZK)</a> proofs offer a more advanced solution by enabling exchanges to mathematically prove they are fully backed without revealing sensitive data, paving the way for proof-of-solvency audits.</p><p>A ZK-proof-based PoR system could allow an exchange to mathematically prove that its reserves exceed its liabilities without revealing individual account balances or wallet addresses. This eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive user data while still providing strong cryptographic assurance that the exchange is solvent. Some blockchain projects and exchanges are experimenting with ZK-proofs for PoR, but adoption remains in the early stages.</p><p>Ultimately, PoR audits are a critical step in improving transparency in crypto markets, especially after past <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-crypto-exchanges-handle-liquidity-crises-after-major-hacks\">exchange failures like FTX</a>, which falsely represented its reserves. By combining Merkle trees with ZK-proofs, the industry could move toward proof-of-solvency audits, which not only verify reserves but also ensure an exchange does not carry undisclosed debts.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the differences between Merkle tree-based PoR and zero-knowledge proof-based PoR:</p><p><img alt=\"Merkle tree-based PoR vs. zero-knowledge proof-based PoR\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/0a53fc681c51be4569815ae99b538937.jpg\" title=\"Merkle tree-based PoR vs. zero-knowledge proof-based PoR\" /></p><p>If widely adopted, these methods could enhance trust in centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining user privacy, offering a regulatory-friendly yet decentralized approach to crypto financial accountability.</p><p>Below is a list of exchanges and their PoR audit details.</p><p><img alt=\"Exchanges and their PoR audit details\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/d40ff3f7affbaba060f9dba98933f688.jpg\" title=\"Exchanges and their PoR audit details\" /></p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/how-the-bybit-hack-happened\">Following a hack</a> in February 2025, Bybit underwent a comprehensive PoR audit <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bybit-hack-withdrawals-5-3b-reserves-secure-hacken\">conducted by the cybersecurity firm Hacken</a>. This audit confirmed that Bybit&rsquo;s holdings fully covered user liabilities, maintaining a 1:1 ratio for all in-scope assets. The audit encompassed a full verification of wallets containing 40 different asset types, ensuring transparency and security for all users.</em></p><h2>What is Coinbase&rsquo;s cbBTC, and how does it ensure trust through PoR?</h2><p>Coinbase&rsquo;s cbBTC is a token that represents Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) 1:1 onchain, fully backed by the equivalent amount of Bitcoin held in Coinbase&rsquo;s custody. By wrapping BTC into cbBTC, users can interact with it in <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications\">decentralized applications (DApps)</a> and across various blockchains, such as Ethereum, Solana and Base, while retaining its Bitcoin value.</p><p>Coinbase uses PoR to ensure transparency and verify that the wrapped cbBTC tokens are fully backed by actual Bitcoin reserves held by Coinbase. PoR audits confirm that Coinbase holds sufficient Bitcoin in its reserves to support all issued cbBTC, maintaining trust and security for users who wrap or redeem their Bitcoin.</p><h3>PoR audit and transparency for cbBTC</h3><ul><li><strong>1:1 backing of cbBTC by Bitcoin: </strong>Coinbase ensures that for every cbBTC token issued, there is an equivalent amount of Bitcoin securely stored in its <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/various-forms-of-bitcoin-custody-explained\">custody</a>. This process ensures the integrity and security of cbBTC, allowing users to confidently use their wrapped tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) and across multiple blockchain platforms.</li><li><strong>PoR for user assurance: </strong>PoR audits help verify Coinbase&rsquo;s claims by cross-checking its Bitcoin reserves with the number of cbBTC tokens in circulation. This audit ensures that users&rsquo; wrapped tokens are always fully backed, offering additional security and transparency. As part of its PoR commitment, Coinbase has published audit reports that confirm its reserves.</li><li><strong>Secure handling of Bitcoin reserves: </strong>Coinbase ensures that the Bitcoin backing cbBTC is not sold, transferred or used for other purposes. The Bitcoin is held securely to maintain the 1:1 backing for cbBTC, ensuring that users can redeem their wrapped tokens for Bitcoin at any time.</li></ul><p>CbBTC is accessible to Coinbase customers with verified accounts who are based in select regions, including the US (excluding New York), the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA), Australia, Singapore and Brazil. Additionally, users can acquire cbBTC through Coinbase Wallet or other third-party exchanges that offer support for it.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> While Coinbase provides transparency through PoR, you should be aware that the wrapping or unwrapping of cbBTC does not constitute a taxable event for the IRS, as clarified by Coinbase. However, you should consult tax professionals for personalized guidance.</em></p><h2>Limitations of PoR approach</h2><p>While proof-of-reserves audits verify that exchanges hold assets, they fail to account for liabilities, creating a false sense of security. Additionally, PoR audits are mere snapshots with no real-time oversight.</p><p>While proof-of-reserves audits enhance transparency by verifying that exchanges hold sufficient assets, they come with notable limitations that can create a false sense of security.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Liability exclusion concern: </strong>One of the biggest concerns is the exclusion of liabilities. PoR audits only confirm the assets an exchange holds, not whether they have outstanding debts, obligations or hidden leverage.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This was a critical issue with FTX, which falsely presented itself as solvent by showcasing its assets without disclosing the massive liabilities owed to creditors and users. Without a simultaneous proof-of-liabilities (PoL) audit, an exchange can appear well-funded while actually being deeply insolvent. Both assets and liabilities are needed to be included in this exercise for it to be completely useful.</p><ul><li><strong>Snapshot audits and ongoing solvency risks: </strong>Another key limitation is the snapshot nature of these audits, which provide verification for a single moment in time but do not guarantee ongoing solvency. An exchange could pass a PoR audit today and deplete reserves the next day by moving funds, taking on new liabilities or engaging in risky lending practices.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For instance, when Binance published its first PoR audit in December 2022, it faced criticism because it was a one-time report rather than a real-time solvency check. Unlike traditional finance, where banks undergo continuous regulatory scrutiny and stress tests, crypto PoR audits lack ongoing oversight, leaving room for manipulation between audit periods. Some firms, like Nexo, introduced real-time PoR in 2021 but discontinued it in 2024, as their auditors could no longer support the capability.</p><ul><li><strong>Reliance on third-party auditors: </strong>Lastly, PoR audits rely heavily on third-party auditors, making their effectiveness dependent on the credibility and independence of the auditing firm. Some exchanges have opted for internal audits, which raises concerns about objectivity and transparency.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A case in point is Mazars Group, the auditing firm that conducted PoR reports for Binance and Crypto.com in 2022. It later withdrew from providing crypto audit services, citing concerns over the reliability of the process. This incident underscored the industry&rsquo;s need for stronger, independent and standardized auditing frameworks to ensure that PoR audits genuinely reflect an exchange&rsquo;s financial health rather than serving as a mere public relations tool.</p><h2>Proof-of-reserves as a step forward, not a perfect solution</h2><p>PoR is a good step in the right direction. It is not perfect, but there is no need to make perfection an enemy of progress. Many of the recent developments in the cryptocurrency industry look promising, where PoR can not only serve native crypto assets but could also help traditional finance when their assets and liabilities are tokenized.&nbsp;</p><p>In its ideal form, PoR should be used to assess the solvency of any counterparty, whether in DeFi, centralized finance (CeFi) or traditional finance (TradFi), making the future of finance more robust and reliable with its implementation</p><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 8px;\"></h2></h2>\n</p>",
